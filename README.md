# Taskall

## What is TaskAll?
TaskAll is a portable, Javascript-based web application perfectly suited for professional task assignment and management. The app allows the user to sign in using their Google account, and add multiple organizations under their account. For each organization, the user can use the app to manage the task in a to-do list style, allowing them to remove the tasks from the list as they complete them. This app also promotes team effort within an organization as people under the same organization can see each otherâ€™s tasks, allowing for better communication and instantaneous seamless co-operation. The app can also be accessed from anywhere, at any time, on any device, thanks to the HTML nature of the app, allowing for effortless on-the-go task management and co-operation.

## How we built it
TaskAll is composed of a Golang backend with a ReactJS web interface. A web interface with React was chosen to give all members an introduction to front-end programming, as most members only had previous experience in C++/Java. 

## Challenges Encountered
One of the challenges we encountered was the steep learning curve due to the fact that it was the first time that many members had created a web app.

We also had difficulty configuring the Google OAuth authentication with the database on the server.

Also, many members had issues in configuring their work environment due to issues with Windows interacting with Golang. A recommendation for the future would be to ensure that all required software, libraries and configurations are operational before the hackathon commences.
